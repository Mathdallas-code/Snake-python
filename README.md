Snake is a game where you need to control a snake to eat apples while avoiding ramming into yourself or the wall.

Controls - WSAD or arrow keys

I made this when I was learning pygame.
Known bugs: Sometimes the apples don't spawn

## How to play

1. Download this repo
2. Install pygame
3. Run main.py
